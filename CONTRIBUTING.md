## Welcome to my website!

Thank you so much for visiting! This has been a labor of love, and it means a
lot that you would take the time to look at its source.

This website is still under active construction, so I don't have any structure
to offer you. If you want to take time out of your day to look at this code and
make it better, be my guest! I'm open to any and all ideas and will try to get
back to your issues / PRs within two days of your initial post.
